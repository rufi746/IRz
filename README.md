This is a framework with the forensics tools I use. It helps keep things in one location. It has some application that you will need to install like NetworkMiner, CapTipper and Wireshark. It uses Virus Totals API and other websites used for finding malicious content/urls/websites. 

Note: NetworkMiner is a windows app so you will need to install mono to run it. Also CapTipper you can find on github and wireshark - install it normally. Also you need to get a VirusTotal API and add it.

It is a work in progress so pleas be kind. If there are any tools that you think I should add let me know.
